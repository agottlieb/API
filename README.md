This API project is a combination of two beginner tuotorials: one in using OAuth tokens with vanilla JS and the other in using fetch API data to get data on a website. Initially I learned how to hide the API key, but then realized that no
one could see the pictures and since the information is not that sensitive, I decided to leave it visible. 


Basic format is from Chris Ferdinandi with vanilla js:
