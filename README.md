This API project is a combination of two beginner tuotorials: one that teaches how to use OAuth tokens with vanilla JS, and the other that teaches how to fetch API data and record it to a website. Initially I hid the API key because it's generally not a good idea to have them public, but I also wanted others to be able to use the website without copying and pasting the API.  Since the information is not particularly sensitive, I decided to leave the API key visible. 


Here are the resources I used:
Basic format is from Chris Ferdinandi with vanilla js:
